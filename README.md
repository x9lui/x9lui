Hii!! My name is Luis but everyone knows me by lui. I'm a student of CS at ESI in CÃ¡diz, Spain.
I'm very interested in the new technologies and everything of my field. I always try my best to learn in the "right way" that is understanding what I'm doing and __not solving problems like using a recipe__.
